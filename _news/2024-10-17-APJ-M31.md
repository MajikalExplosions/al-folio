We are pleased to announce our paper "[Variable Stars in M31 Stellar Clusters from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6eff/meta){:target="_blank"}" has been published by the American Astronomical Society on October 17, 2024.

I am delighted to share a milestone in my research journey. A project I joined in June 2020, during my junior year of high school, has culminated in a publication in a premier astrophysical journal. This four-year journey has taught me firsthand that meaningful research requires persistence and patience. I am deeply grateful to my mentors, Dr. [Monika D. Soraisam](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1915247) and Prof. [Puragra Guhathakurta](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=pguhatha), for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey.
