I am <span style="font-size: 32px;">Joseph Liu</span>.
##### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹.  Glad to see you here!! ðŸŽŠ
\
I am a senior Computer Science student at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu). As someone who thrives on exploration rather than repetition, I am passionate about leveraging technology to simplify people's lives by automating tedious tasks â€“ from daily chores and writing to autonomous driving. This vision has led me to explore the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am pursuing dual research tracks at USC with the support of the [CURVE](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/research/curve/) and [Provost](https://careers.usc.edu/experiences/usc-provosts-undergrad-research-fellowships-2/) Fellowships. Under Prof. [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/)'s guidance and mentorship of [Xinyue Cui](https://x-f-cui.github.io/website/), I develop evaluation methodologies for assessing Large Language Models' performance in text simplification tasks. Under Prof. [Sven Koenig](https://ics.uci.edu/~svenk/)'s advisement and [Yimin Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/yimintang)'s mentorship, I work on multi-agent pathfinding, implementing custom Gymnasium environments for training reinforcement learning models in Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) algorithms. Our research in both domains is progressing toward publication submissions by the end of this year.
