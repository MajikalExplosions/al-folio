<p style="font-size: 1.3rem;"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹.  Glad to see you here!! ðŸŽŠ</p>

I am a senior Computer Science student at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu). What excites me most about research in computer science is my long-held belief that it is uniquely positioned to enable people to dedicate their time to what matters most to them. Almost everyone encounters tasks that they consider necessary yet tedious; for some, it's their routine paperwork, and for others, it might be something as mundane as household chores. Regardless of the specific task, computer scienceâ€”particularly machine learning, robotics, and natural language processingâ€”has demonstrated remarkable potential to assist humans with these responsibilities, freeing up time for more meaningful pursuits. Driven by both my passion for the field and my conviction in its transformative potential, my goal is to become a research scientist exploring the frontiers of machine learning.

Currently, I am pursuing dual research tracks at USC with the support of the [CURVE](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/research/curve/) and [Provost](https://careers.usc.edu/experiences/usc-provosts-undergrad-research-fellowships-2/) Fellowships. Under Prof. [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/)'s guidance and mentorship of [Xinyue Cui](https://x-f-cui.github.io/website/), I am developing evaluation methodologies for assessing Large Language Models' performance in text simplification tasks. Under Prof. [Sven Koenig](https://ics.uci.edu/~svenk/)'s advisement and [Yimin Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/yimintang)'s mentorship, I am working on multi-agent pathfinding, implementing custom Gymnasium environments for training reinforcement learning models in Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) algorithms. Our research in both domains is progressing toward publication submissions by the end of this year or early next year.
