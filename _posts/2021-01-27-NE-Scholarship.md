I am honored to be selected by the Northeastern University Admissions Committee for the prestigious [Northeastern University Honors Scholarship](https://joseph.liu.us/assets/pdf/2021-0127-Northeastern-Scholarship.pdf). This merit-based award recognizes incoming students admitted to the Northeastern University Honors Program. The scholarship provides $22,000 for the first year, followed by $11,000 per semester in subsequent years, for a total award of up to $88,000 over the course of study.
