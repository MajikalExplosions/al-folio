I am delighted to announce the submission of our research paper, "[Symbolic Representation for Any-to-Any Generative Tasks](/r?r={{- "/assets/pdf/2024-1100-Symbolic-Representation.pdf" | escape -}}){:target="_blank"}," to the 2025 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). This work represents a collaborative effort with my colleagues to advance the field of computer vision and generative AI.

The paper is currently under review. CVPR, as one of the premier conferences in computer vision and machine learning, provides an excellent platform for disseminating our work to the broader research community.

*Note: The conference's peer review process is ongoing, and acceptance notifications are pending.*
