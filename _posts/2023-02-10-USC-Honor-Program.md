So, I stumbled upon something pretty cool at USC the other day - it's called the [W.V.T. Rusch Undergraduate Engineering Honors Program](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/ehp/). After diving into their website and checking out what it's all about, I've been going back and forth about whether to throw my hat in the ring.

You know what? I think I'm gonna go for it! I'm actually getting kind of excited about this! I'll keep you posted on how my application goes - fingers crossed! ðŸ¤ž

Stay tuned for updates!
