I just got into Santa Clara University with a [merit scholarship](https://joseph.liu.us/assets/pdf/2021-0318-SCU-Scholarship.pdf) of $8,100 per year! ðŸŽ‰ While I'm excited about this acceptance and scholarship, I'm still anxiously checking my email every day for responses from my target and dream schools. Fingers crossed everything goes according to plan! ðŸ¤ž
