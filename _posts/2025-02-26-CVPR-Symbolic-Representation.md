I am delighted to announce that our research paper, "[Symbolic Representation for Any-to-Any Generative Tasks](/r?r={{- "/assets/pdf/2024-1100-Symbolic-Representation.pdf" | escape -}}){:target="_blank"}," has been accepted by the 2025 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). This work represents a collaborative effort with my colleagues to advance the field of generative AI.

CVPR, as one of the premier conferences in computer vision and machine learning, provides an excellent platform for disseminating our work to the broader research community.
