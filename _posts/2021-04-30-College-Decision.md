I've made my decision - I'll be starting my college journey at Santa Clara University this fall! 🎓 While I'm excited to begin my freshman year at SCU, I'm also planning to apply for transfer for sophomore year. It's not a conventional path, but sometimes the best journeys aren't straight lines! Wish me luck on this adventure!! 🍀✨
