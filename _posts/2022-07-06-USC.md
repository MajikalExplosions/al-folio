I've decided to continue my college studies at USC. After considering my options between University of Michigan, UC San Diego, and National University of Singapore, I chose USC primarily for its favorable professor-to-student ratio. This was a key factor in my decision since I'm keen to get involved in research. With just over two years until grad school application deadlines, I'm planning to join a lab soon and begin building my research experience. Looking forward to making the most of this opportunity.
