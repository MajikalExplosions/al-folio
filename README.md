This is my website forked from [alshedivat/al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and
customized. 

I am using the Docker for my local setup.  See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for information.

See [CUSTOMIZE.md](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/CUSTOMIZE.md) for customization. I moved the `resume.json` from `assets/json/` to `_data/` as I feel it's a more logical place for it. Beside, `_data/` is where `cv.yml` located.
